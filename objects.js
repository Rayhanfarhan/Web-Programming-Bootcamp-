//objects are more dynamic because we can add attributes to an object
// we can access objects using .method, 
// (user.age, user.name)
// We can manually add/change properties directly from the console

//An array is just a container without attributes,object is a container with multiple attributes with code organisation
//We can add array inside of an object
//We can add objects inside of an array, here we have added 2 users inside an array

//An array can also be empty
// var emptyObj = null;(There is nothing in this object)
